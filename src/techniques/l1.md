# L1 Distance

## Median

Given `n` points [{x}] on a line and a non-negative integer `s`,
ind a interval `p..=(p+s)` that minimize the total distance from every points to the interval.

[{ p = "argmin"_p F(p) = "argmin"_p sum_i f(i; p) " where " }]
[{ f(i; p) = {(p - x_i, if x_i < p), (0, if p <= x <= p + s), (x_i - (p + s), if x_i > p + s) :} }]


Differentiate [{F(p)}]:
[{ d/(dp) F(p) = sum_i d/(dp) f(p; i) = sum_i ({(+1, if x_i < p), (0, if p <= x <= p + s), (-1, if x_i > p + s) :}) }]

[{ F'(p) = 0 }] occurs when the number of [{x_i < p}] equals to the number of [{ x_i > p + s }].
That is, the [{p}] that makes the number of [{p > x_i}] equals to the number of [{ p < x_i - s }].
Which is [{ "median"([x_i] uu [x_i - s]) }].


## Pairwise L1 Distance

Give a sequence [{A}], Find [{ sum_(i < j) |A_i - A_j|  }]. 
Since L1 distance is commutative, we can sort the sequence.

```rust
fn f(mut arr: Vec<i64>) -> i64 {
    if arr.len() == 0 {
        return 0;
    }
    arr.sort();
    let mut ans = 0;
    let mut sum = arr[0];
    for i in 1..arr.len() {
        ans += i as i64 * arr[i] - sum;
        sum += arr[i];
    }
    ans
}
```

## 2D Points

> Given N points, find the maximum L1 distance between any pair of points.

Map points from [{(x, y)}] to [{(u, v)}] where [{u = x + y, v = x - y}]. 
Usually, [{(u, v)}] can be solved independently.

$$
\begin{align*}
&\max_{0 \le i,j \lt N} |x_i - x_j| + | y_i - y_j| \\\\
&= \max_{0 \le i,j \lt N} \left(\max(x_i - x_j, x_j - x_i) + max(y_i - y_j, y_j - y_i) \right)\\\\
&= \max_{0 \le i,j \lt N} \left(max(
(x_i - x_j + y_i - y_j), 
(x_i - x_j + y_j - y_i),
(x_j - x_i + y_i - y_j),
(x_j - x_i + y_j - y_i)
) \right)\\\\
&= \max_{0 \le i,j \lt N} max(u_i - u_j, v_i - v_j, v_j - v_i, u_j - u_i) \\\\
&= max(    
    \max_{0 \le i,j \lt N} (u_i - u_j),
    \max_{0 \le i,j \lt N} (v_i - v_j),
    \max_{0 \le i,j \lt N} (v_j - v_i),
    \max_{0 \le i,j \lt N} (u_j - u_i)) \\\\
&= max(
    (\max_{0 \le i \lt N} u_i - \min_{0 \le j \lt N} u_j),
    (\max_{0 \le i \lt N} v_i - \min_{0 \le j \lt N} v_j),
    (\max_{0 \le j \lt N} v_j - \min_{0 \le i \lt N} v_i),
    (\max_{0 \le j \lt N} u_j - \min_{0 \le i \lt N} u_i)) \\\\
&= max(
    (\max_{0 \le i \lt N} u_i - \min_{0 \le i \lt N} u_i),
    (\max_{0 \le i \lt N} v_i - \min_{0 \le i \lt N} v_i)
)
\end{align*}
$$


> Given N points, for each point, find the distance to its closest neighboring point.

For a point [{(x, y)]}, if we only inpsect its upper-right points:

[{ min_(x_i >= x, y_i >= y) (x_i - x + y_i - y) = (min_(x_i >= x, y_i >= y) (x_i + y_i)) - (x + y)}]

It is similar to the 2D Poset Problem which can be solved using sweep line and SegTree.
For upper-left, lower-left, lower-right, we can simply flip the points (along x-axis or y-axis) and run the algorithm again.

> Given N points, find the total distance of all pair of points.
> Distance is defined as the minimum number of moves:
> [{(x, y) -> (x + 1, y + 1), (x + 1, y - 1), (x - 1, y + 1), (x - 1, y - 1)}]

Map all the points from [{(x, y)}] to [{(u, v)}] where [{u = x + y, v = x - y}].
A move in [{(x, y)}] is [{2}] unit of distance in [{(u, v)}] and [{u, v}] is independent of each other.
This indicates that we can classify points into 2 groups via parity.
For each group, the problem reduce to 1D L1 distance problem.
